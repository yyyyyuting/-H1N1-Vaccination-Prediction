## Introduction
We want to take a look into how people are getting promoted in the workplace and what aspects are been taken in to consideration when making the decision.

With the dataset we found on kaggle, there are more than 10 varibles data being collected to determine the promotion. Some of the attributes are very simple and starightforward while others can be hard to measure and determined consistently.

One that intereted us the most is the previous year work rating of employees. we wanted to see what goes into the rating process and are genders been treated evenly across the board.

## Workplace Status
I found some interesting data about the gender bias in the workplace. According to the Glassdoor research, the percentages of female employees at major tech companies are still not at parity to male employees. Here is the number. Twitter: 43%, Facebook: 37%, Apple: 34%, Google: 32%, Intel: 26%. In addition, women make up total 45% of employees of S&P 500 companies. However, females employees are only make up 6% of CEO, 27% of Senior level managers.

Moreover, women are more likely to receive critical feedback, 88%, compared to 59% for men. At the same time, these feedbacks are more based on their personality traits. One of our research also showed that reviews for women had vague praise more often than reviews for men (57%, compared with 43% for men). Here is an example of the feedback: “You had a great year” populated many women’s reviews.

## Conclusion
Whenever an evaluation or rating process is conducted by people in the work place there are possibilities of human bias and unfairness involved. To best eliminate the bias possibility, one should alway consider additional steps and extra procedures to improve the evaluation.
